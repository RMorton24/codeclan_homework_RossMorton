Find the proportion of employees in each department who are grade 1.
Hints
Think of the desired proportion for a given department as the number of employees

You can write an expression in a SELECT statement, e.g. grade = 1. 
This would result in BOOLEAN values.

If you could convert BOOLEAN to INTEGER 1 and 0, you could sum them. The CAST() 
function lets you convert data types.

In SQL, an INTEGER divided by an INTEGER yields an INTEGER. To get a REAL value, 
you need to convert the top, bottom or both sides of the division to REAL. */

/*Some of these problems may need you to do some online research on SQL statements
we haven�t seen in the lessons up until now� Don�t worry, we�ll give you pointers, 
and it�s good practice looking up help and answers online, data analysts and 
programmers do this all the time! If you get stuck, it might also help to 
sketch out a rough version of the table you want on paper (the column headings 
and first few rows are usually enough).

Note that some of these questions may be best answered using CTEs or window functions: 
have a look at the optional lesson included in today�s notes!*/

/*Question 2.
Have a look again at your table for MVP question 6. It will likely contain a 
blank cell for the row relating to employees with �unknown� pension enrollment 
status. This is ambiguous: it would be better if this cell contained �unknown� 
or something similar. Can you find a way to do this, perhaps using a combination 
of COALESCE() and CAST(), or a CASE statement?

Hints
COALESCE() lets you substitute a chosen value for NULLs in a column, 
e.g. COALESCE(text_column, 'unknown') would substitute 'unknown' for every NULL 
in text_column. The substituted value has to match the data type of the column 
otherwise PostgreSQL will return an error.

CAST() let�s you change the data type of a column, e.g. CAST(boolean_column AS VARCHAR)
will turn TRUE values in boolean_column into text 'true', FALSE to text 'false', 
and will leave NULLs as NULL*/
