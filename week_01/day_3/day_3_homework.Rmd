# Import packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
movies_raw_data <- read_csv("data/movies.csv")
```

# Question 1

Could rename some of the functions as they could be confusing.
There are two title columns
Some data sets have NA values. 
_Budget, runtime and revenue_ fields have 0- is this real or method of missing data?


## Question 2
```{r}
#Question 2
movies_selected <- movies_raw_data %>% 
  select(title, runtime, budget)
```
## Question 3
```{r}
# Provides a summary table whether 
movies_selected %>% 
  summarise(across(runtime:budget,is.na
               )) %>% 
  summarise(across(is.logical, sum, .names = "missing_values_in_{.col}"))

# Looking at each individual column
movies_selected %>% 
  filter(is.na(runtime)) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  pull()

movies_selected %>% 
  filter(is.na(budget)) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  pull()

# Quick way for overall
sum(is.na(movies_selected))
```



## Question 4
```{r}
movies_runtime <- movies_selected  %>% 
  mutate(runtime = na_if(runtime,"0"))

movies_runtime %>% 
  filter(is.na(runtime)) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  pull()
```


## Question 5
```{r}
# Change the runtime column value with 0 to the median
movies_imputed <- movies_runtime %>% 
  mutate(runtime = coalesce(runtime, 
                            median(runtime, na.rm=TRUE)
                            )
         )
# Another Check for the median
median(movies_imputed$runtime, na.rm=TRUE)

# Check to see if any NA's
movies_imputed %>% 
  filter(is.na(runtime)) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  pull()      
         
```

## Question 6
```{r}
#Least runtime
movies_imputed %>% 
  slice_min(runtime, n = 10)

# Most runtime
movies_imputed %>% 
  slice_max(runtime, n = 10)
```

## Question 7
```{r}
median_budget <- median(movies_imputed$budget)
movies_imputes <- movies_imputed %>%
  mutate(budget = if_else(budget < 100, median_budget, budget)
         )
```


## Extension Q1

```{r}
movie_budgets <- movies_imputes %>% 
  mutate(budget_type = case_when(
                                budget <= 12e6 ~ "Small Budget",
                                budget < 40e6 & budget > 12e6 ~ "Medium Budget",
                                budget >= 40e6 ~ "Big Budget"
                                )
        )
```


## Extension Q2

```{r}
movies_raw_data %>% 
  summarise(across(
                  where(is.character),
                   is.na
                  )
            ) %>%
  summarise(across(is.logical, sum, .names = "missing_values_in_{col}"))


movies_raw_data %>% 
  summarise(across(
                  where(is.numeric),
                   is.na
                  )
            ) %>%
  summarise(across(is.logical, sum, .names = "missing_values_in_{col}"))
            
```
